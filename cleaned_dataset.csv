list symptoms commonly seen disease however important note combination symptoms varies greatly person person fever headache chills malaise muscle pain nausea vomiting diarrhea confusion conjunctival

adults rash commonly reported patients infected ehrlichia ewingii ehrlichia murislike organism rash associated ehrlichia chaffeensis infection may range maculopapular petechial nature usually pruritic itchy rash usually spares face cases may spread palms soles type rash called erythroderma may develop patients erythroderma type rash resembles sunburn consists widespread reddening skin may peel several days patients may develop rash resembles rash rocky mountain spotted fever making two diseases difficult differentiate basis clinical signs alone immunecompromised individuals severity ehrlichiosis may depend part immune status patient persons compromised immunity caused immunosuppressive therapies eg corticosteroids cancer chemotherapy longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant hiv infection splenectomy appear develop severe disease may also higher casefatality rates ie proportion patients die infection blood transfusion organ transplant risks associated ehrlichia species ehrlichia organisms infect white blood cells circulate blood stream pathogens may pose risk transmitted blood transfusions ehrlichia chaffeensis shown survive week refrigerated blood several instances suspected e chaffeensis transmission solid organ transplant investigated although date cases confirmed attributed route transmission patients develop ehrlichiosis within month receiving blood transfusion solid organ transplant reported state health officials prompt investigation use leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease risk transfusionassociated

although positive pcr result helpful negative result completely rule diagnosis first week illness microscopic examination blood smears known peripheral blood smear may reveal morulae microcolonies ehrlichiae cytoplasm white blood cells patients type blood cell morulae observed may provide insight infecting species e chaffeensis commonly infects monocytes whereas e ewingii commonly infect

cultures cannot detect ehrlichia person develops ehrlichiosis immune system produces antibodies ehrlichia detectable antibody titers usually observed days illness onset important note antibodies detectable first week illness patients negative test time rule ehrlichiosis cause illness gold standard serologic test diagnosis ehrlichiosis indirect immunofluorescence assay ifa using e chaffeensis antigen performed paired serum samples demonstrate significant fourfold rise antibody titers first sample taken early disease possible preferably first week symptoms second sample taken weeks later cases ehrlichiosis first igg ifa titer typically low second typically shows significant fourfold increase igg antibody levels igm antibodies usually rise time igg near end first week illness remain elevated months longer also igm antibodies less specific igg antibodies likely result false positive reasons physicians requesting igm serologic titers also request concurrent igg titer serologic tests based enzyme immunoassay eia technology available commercial laboratories however eia tests qualitative rather quantitative meaning provide positivenegative result less useful measure changes antibody titers paired specimens furthermore eia assays rely evaluation igm antibody alone may higher frequency false positive results antibodies e chaffeensis may remain elevated months longer disease resolved may detected persons previously exposed antigenically related organisms currently healthy people areas may elevated antibody titers due past exposure ehrlichia species similar organisms therefore one sample tested difficult interpret paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating significant fourfold rise antibody titer provides best evidence correct diagnosis ehrlichiosis indepth information diagnosis ehrlichiosis please visit treatment doxycycline first line treatment adults children ages initiated immediately whenever ehrlichiosis suspected use antibiotics
