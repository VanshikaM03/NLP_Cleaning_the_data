The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms of foodborne illnesses include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and chills.\\n                \\nMost foodborne illnesses are acute, meaning they happen suddenly and last a short time, and most people recover on their own without treatment. Rarely, foodborne illnesses may lead to more serious complications. Each year, an estimated 48 million people in the United States experience a foodborne illness. Foodborne illnesses cause about 3,000 deaths in the United States annually.1\",\n          \"Baylisascaris infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with raccoons and their feces. Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.\\n    \\nDo not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets. Infection rarely causes symptoms in raccoons, so you cannot tell if a raccoon is infected by observing its behavior. Roundworm eggs passed in the feces of infected raccoons are not visible to the naked eye. Eggs can only be seen using a microscope.\\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\nYou may discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by taking these steps:\\n    \\n     - prevent access to food\\n     - keep trash containers tightly closed\\n     - close off access to attics and basements\\n     - keep sandboxes covered when not in use (raccoons may use sandboxes as a latrine)\\n     - remove fish ponds -- they eat the fish and drink the water\\n     - eliminate water sources\\n     - remove bird feeders\\n     - clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a den on your property\\n    \\n    \\nStay away from areas and materials that might be contaminated by raccoon feces. Raccoons typically defecate at the base of or in raised forks of trees, or on raised horizontal surfaces such as fallen logs, stumps, or large rocks. Raccoon feces also can be found on woodpiles, decks, rooftops, and in attics, garages, and haylofts. Feces usually are dark and tubular, have a pungent odor (usually worse than dog or cat feces), and often contain undigested seeds or other food items.\\n    \\nIf you have found a raccoon latrine near your home, cleaning the area may prevent possible infection. Newly deposited eggs take at least 2-4 weeks to become infective. Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.\\n    \\nMore on: Raccoon Latrine Clean-up [PDF, 111 KB, 1 page]\\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\nIf you choose to clean the site yourself, care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes.\\n    \\n     - Wear disposable gloves to help prevent cross contamination.\\n     - Wear a N95-rated respirator if working in a confined space to prevent accidental ingestion of eggs or other harmful materials.\\n     - Avoid stirring up dust and debris- you can lightly mist the latrine area with a little water from a spray bottle to reduce the amount of dust.\\n     - Wear rubber boots that can be scrubbed or cover your shoes with disposable booties that can be thrown away, so that you do not bring eggs into your household.\\n     - Feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill.\\n     - Most chemicals do not kill roundworm eggs; however, heat kills the eggs instantly.\\n     - Treat feces-soiled decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane torch (please contact your local fire department for regulations and safety practices).\\n    \\n    \\nTo help further reduce the risk of possible infection, wash your hands well with soap and warm running water. Clean/launder your clothes thoroughly with hot water and detergent.\\n    \\nMore on: Handwashing\\n    \\nIf you are cleaning an indoor raccoon latrine and are not able to use a propane torch, use a damp (but not wet) sponge to wipe the area with hot soapy water. Rinse your sponge frequently. After you are finished, flush dirty water down the toilet. Place the sponge in a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in the garbage.\\n    \\nContact your local animal control office for additional assistance.\\n    Dogs\\n    \\nDogs may be infected with adult B. procyonis roundworms, but may not show symptoms. Have all pets de-wormed under a veterinarian's supervision and take precautions to avoid contact with their feces.\\n    Exotic pets\\n    \\nRaccoons and dogs are not the only hosts of Baylisascaris. B. procyonis infection has also been documented in kinkajous. Other animals such as coatis may be susceptible. When wild animals are kept as pets, there can be a risk of disease transmission to humans.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms of foodborne illnesses include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and chills.\\n                \\nMost foodborne illnesses are acute, meaning they happen suddenly and last a short time, and most people recover on their own without treatment. Rarely, foodborne illnesses may lead to more serious complications. Each year, an estimated 48 million people in the United States experience a foodborne illness. Foodborne illnesses cause about 3,000 deaths in the United States annually.1\",\n          \"Baylisascaris infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with raccoons and their feces. Washing your hands after working or playing outdoors is good practice for preventing a number of diseases.\\n    \\nDo not keep, feed, or adopt wild animals, including raccoons, as pets. Infection rarely causes symptoms in raccoons, so you cannot tell if a raccoon is infected by observing its behavior. Roundworm eggs passed in the feces of infected raccoons are not visible to the naked eye. Eggs can only be seen using a microscope.\\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\nYou may discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by taking these steps:\\n    \\n     - prevent access to food\\n     - keep trash containers tightly closed\\n     - close off access to attics and basements\\n     - keep sandboxes covered when not in use (raccoons may use sandboxes as a latrine)\\n     - remove fish ponds -- they eat the fish and drink the water\\n     - eliminate water sources\\n     - remove bird feeders\\n     - clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a den on your property\\n    \\n    \\nStay away from areas and materials that might be contaminated by raccoon feces. Raccoons typically defecate at the base of or in raised forks of trees, or on raised horizontal surfaces such as fallen logs, stumps, or large rocks. Raccoon feces also can be found on woodpiles, decks, rooftops, and in attics, garages, and haylofts. Feces usually are dark and tubular, have a pungent odor (usually worse than dog or cat feces), and often contain undigested seeds or other food items.\\n    \\nIf you have found a raccoon latrine near your home, cleaning the area may prevent possible infection. Newly deposited eggs take at least 2-4 weeks to become infective. Prompt removal and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce risk for exposure and possible infection.\\n    \\nMore on: Raccoon Latrine Clean-up [PDF, 111 KB, 1 page]\\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\nIf you choose to clean the site yourself, care should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes.\\n    \\n     - Wear disposable gloves to help prevent cross contamination.\\n     - Wear a N95-rated respirator if working in a confined space to prevent accidental ingestion of eggs or other harmful materials.\\n     - Avoid stirring up dust and debris- you can lightly mist the latrine area with a little water from a spray bottle to reduce the amount of dust.\\n     - Wear rubber boots that can be scrubbed or cover your shoes with disposable booties that can be thrown away, so that you do not bring eggs into your household.\\n     - Feces and material contaminated with raccoon feces should be removed and burned, buried, or sent to a landfill.\\n     - Most chemicals do not kill roundworm eggs; however, heat kills the eggs instantly.\\n     - Treat feces-soiled decks, patios, and other surfaces with boiling water or a propane torch (please contact your local fire department for regulations and safety practices).\\n    \\n    \\nTo help further reduce the risk of possible infection, wash your hands well with soap and warm running water. Clean/launder your clothes thoroughly with hot water and detergent.\\n    \\nMore on: Handwashing\\n    \\nIf you are cleaning an indoor raccoon latrine and are not able to use a propane torch, use a damp (but not wet) sponge to wipe the area with hot soapy water. Rinse your sponge frequently. After you are finished, flush dirty water down the toilet. Place the sponge in a plastic bag and put the plastic bag in the garbage.\\n    \\nContact your local animal control office for additional assistance.\\n    Dogs\\n    \\nDogs may be infected with adult B. procyonis roundworms, but may not show symptoms. Have all pets de-wormed under a veterinarian's supervision and take precautions to avoid contact with their feces.\\n    Exotic pets\\n    \\nRaccoons and dogs are not the only hosts of Baylisascaris. B. procyonis infection has also been documented in kinkajous. Other animals such as coatis may be susceptible. When wild animals are kept as pets, there can be a risk of disease transmission to humans.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1718,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neurological sequelae lupus\",\n          \"need know crohns disease\",\n          \"diagnose chapare hemorrhagic fever chhf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1940,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"unlike inflammatory bowel diseases crohns disease ulcerative colitis microscopic colitis increase persons risk getting colon cancer\",\n          \"foodborne illnesses infections irritations gastrointestinal gi tract caused food beverages contain harmful bacteria parasites viruses chemicals gi tract series hollow organs joined long twisting tube mouth anus common symptoms foodborne illnesses include vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain fever chills foodborne illnesses acute meaning happen suddenly last short time people recover without treatment rarely foodborne illnesses may lead serious complications year estimated million people united states experience foodborne illness foodborne illnesses cause deaths united states\",\n          \"baylisascaris infection prevented avoiding contact raccoons feces washing hands working playing outdoors good practice preventing number diseases keep feed adopt wild animals including raccoons pets infection rarely causes symptoms raccoons cannot tell raccoon infected observing behavior roundworm eggs passed feces infected raccoons visible naked eye eggs seen using microscope may discourage raccoons living around home parks taking steps prevent access food keep trash containers tightly closed close access attics basements keep sandboxes covered use raccoons may use sandboxes latrine remove fish ponds eat fish drink water eliminate water sources remove bird feeders clear brush raccoons likely make den property stay away areas materials might contaminated raccoon feces raccoons typically defecate base raised forks trees raised horizontal surfaces fallen logs stumps large rocks raccoon feces also found woodpiles decks rooftops attics garages haylofts feces usually dark tubular pungent odor usually worse dog cat feces often contain undigested seeds food items found raccoon latrine near home cleaning area may prevent possible infection newly deposited eggs take least weeks become infective prompt removal destruction raccoon feces reduce risk exposure possible infection raccoon latrine cleanup pdf kb page choose clean site care taken avoid contaminating hands clothes wear disposable gloves help prevent cross contamination wear respirator working confined space prevent accidental ingestion eggs harmful materials avoid stirring dust debris lightly mist latrine area little water spray bottle reduce amount dust wear rubber boots scrubbed cover shoes disposable booties thrown away bring eggs household feces material contaminated raccoon feces removed burned buried sent landfill chemicals kill roundworm eggs however heat kills eggs instantly treat fecessoiled decks patios surfaces boiling water propane torch please contact local fire department regulations safety practices help reduce risk possible infection wash hands well soap warm running water cleanlaunder clothes thoroughly hot water detergent handwashing cleaning indoor raccoon latrine able use propane torch use damp wet sponge wipe area hot soapy water rinse sponge frequently finished flush dirty water toilet place sponge plastic bag put plastic bag garbage contact local animal control office additional assistance dogs dogs may infected adult b procyonis roundworms may show symptoms pets dewormed veterinarians supervision take precautions avoid contact feces exotic pets raccoons dogs hosts baylisascaris b procyonis infection also documented kinkajous animals coatis may susceptible wild animals kept pets risk disease transmission humans\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

urgency feeling need go right urgency normal havent near bathroom hour drinking lot fluid may problem strong urge bladder time fill sudden feel strong urge go time may even accident urge strike quickly dont time find bathroom frequency feeling need go much often anyone else doctor nurse use term void mean empty bladder people void four seven time day drinking large amount fluid cause frequent voiding taking blood pressure medicine called diuretic water pill also cause frequent voiding void eight time day dont take diuretic drink large amount fluid may sign problem pain feeling discomfort need go full bladder may uncomfortable painful may problem feel burning sharp pain bladder urethrathe opening urine leaf body people may pain without urgency frequency others urgency frequency without pain cause need know interstitial cystitispainful bladder syndrome many different problem cause urgency frequency bladder pain infection bowel disorder endometriosistissue normally

affected men occur age common middle age people icpbs rarely bladder pain time pain usually come go bladder fill empty pain may go away week month return people icpbs sometimes refer attack bladder pain flare flareup stress may bring flareup symptom someone icpbs stress cause person get icpbs diagnose need know interstitial cystitispainful bladder syndrome finding cause bladder pain may require several test test may aid doctor making diagnosis icpbs careful review symptom physical exam office generally important part evaluation treatment need know interstitial cystitispainful bladder syndrome one treatment icpbs found work everyone doctor nurse work find treatment plan meet special need plan may include diet lifestyle change bladder retraining activity exercise physical therapy various type medicine expect treatment failure along way time doctor nurse find treatment give relief help cope disease diet lifestyle change people icpbs find certain food drink bring symptom others find link symptom eat learning food cause symptom may require trial error keep food diary note time bladder pain diary might reveal flareups always happen example eat tomato orange doctor recommend taking antacid medicine meal medicine reduces amount acid get urine make change diet remember eat variety healthy food bladder retraining bladder retraining way help bladder hold urine people bladder pain often get habit using bathroom soon feel pain urgency feel need go bladder really full body may get used frequent voiding bladder retraining help bladder hold urine signaling urge urinate keep bladder diary track start noting time void note much time go void example may find return bathroom every minute try stretch time void usually void every minute try wait least minute go bathroom bladder becomes painful may use bathroom may find first urge use bathroom go away ignore find way relax distract first urge strike day may able stretch time minute may find urge urinate return soon activity icpbs may feel last thing want exercise many people feel easy activity like walking gentle stretching exercise help relieve symptom physical therapy doctor nurse may suggest pelvic exercise pelvic muscle hold bladder place help control urination first step find right muscle squeeze doctor nurse physical therapist help one way find muscle imagine trying stop passing gas squeeze muscle would use sense pulling feeling found right muscle pelvic exercise may need exercise strengthen muscle easier hold urine may need learn relax pelvic muscle tense muscle part bladder pain physical therapist specialize helping people pelvic pain ask doctor nurse help find professional trained pelvic floor physical therapy reducing stress stress doesnt cause icpbs stress trigger painful flareups someone icpbs learning reduce stress life making time relaxation every day may help control symptom icpbs oral medicine pain pill like aspirin ibuprofen acetominophen help control mild bladder pain advil motrin example ibuprofen tylenol example acetominophen talk doctor feel need stronger pain medicine doctor may recommend medication pentosan polysulfate sodium sold elmiron approved treating pain icpbs may need take medicine month notice improvement elmiron work everyone people icpbs found relief taking need doctor order elmiron dont notice improvement symptom month medicine likely work researcher also looking kind medicine medicine treat heartburn might help bladder symptom reducing amount acid made body muscle relaxant keep bladder squeezing wrong time keeping bladder muscle relaxed help ease symptom icpbs bladder stretching doctor may stretch bladder filling liquid given anesthetic prevent pain help relax bladder muscle patient said symptom helped treatment bladder medicine many patient icpbs find relief treatment bladder filled liquid medicine doctor guide tube bladder slowly fill bladder liquid eas irritation bladder wall liquid may compound called dmso solution contains heparin pain medicine called lidocaine keep liquid bladder minute release treatment every week every week month may feel better third fourth treatment nerve stimulation tried diet
